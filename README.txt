# Glowstick Deliverance Infinite

**A game by XCVG (https://www.xcvgsystems.com/)**

**Created for BC Game Jam 2021 (https://bcgamejam.com/)**

**Version 1.1.0, 2021-09-19**

## Introduction

Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, there is no in-person jam, which means no glowsticks â˜¹

But we are game devs! We create worlds! So let's use our infinite powers of imagination to turn this into something exciting!

You are Mira, probable anime protagonist, possible magical girl, and definite mechanical genius! You have an improbable rocket car (hey, it's more exciting than my Nissan) and a seemingly infinite supply of glowsticks.

Let's go!

## How To Play

This is an infinite runner of sorts where you fly along in your rocket car delivering glowsticks. You do this by throwing them at buildings, because reasons.

As you move along, your energy will run down, but you can replenish it by delivering glowsticks. If you run out, it's game over!

Move your car left and right with the A and D keys on the keyboard.

Aim your glowsticks with the mouse and fling them with the left mouse button.

Watch out: as you get further along, things will speed up!

## System Requirements

Windows 7 64-bit
Dual-core CPU
3GB RAM
DirectX 10 compatible GPU
200MB free hard drive space
1280x720 screen resolution

You can expect the game to load, run, and be some definition of playable with these specs.
